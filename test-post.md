## 🎮 Welcome to Gamefolio – Built to Uplift the Gaming Community

At Gamefolio, we’re not just another gaming website — we’re a community-first platform that exists to support, promote, and celebrate the people behind the games.

Whether you’re a streamer trying to grow your audience, a gamer with an insane clutch moment, or an indie developer looking to shine a light on your creation — you belong here.

### 🚀 What We Do

Gamefolio.com is built for the gaming community, by the community. Our mission is simple:

* 🎥 **Help Streamers Grow*x5  
  We promote streamers by sharing their Twitch and YouTube streams, clips, and highlights across our platform and social channels. Want to be featured? Just send in your best content — we’ll take care of the rest.

* 🎮 **Share Your Greatest Gaming Moments**  
  Gamers can send in their clutch plays, funny fails, or awesome moments, and we’ll showcase them for the world to see. We love the highlights that make you shout, “Did you see that?!”

* 🕹️ **Shine a Spotlight on Indie Games**  
  We’re passionate about indie developers. Gamefolio gives them a platform to highlight their projects, share trailers, post dev logs, and connect with players who care about discovering the next great title.

* 🤝 **Promote Others, Not Just Ourselves**  
  This isn’t about algorithms or popularity contests. Gamefolio is about lifting each other up — helping creators be seen, gamers be heard, and developers get discovered. If you win, we all win.

### 💬 Why We Started Gamefolio

We saw too many creators and players struggling to get noticed — not because they lacked talent or content, but because they didn’t have the right platform. So, we built one.

Gamefolio exists to amplify others.  
To be the place where gamers support each other.  
Where streamers grow faster together.  
And where developers find an audience who genuinely cares.
